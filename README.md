[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/sgibson91/CompEnv-PairedExample-1/master?urlpath=lab)

## Instructions

1. Click the badge above to launch the example.
   (You may wish to right click and select "Open Link in a New Tab" in order to keep these instructions visible.)
   When it has finished loading, a JupyterLab environment will be visible.

2. At the bottom of the screen, click the "Terminal" button (under "Other").

3. In the terminal which opens, run the command `python test_script.py` and examine the output.

4. In the same terminal, now run `source activate kernel`, re-run `python test_script.py` and examine the output.

You can examine the code in `test_script.py` by double clicking on it in the panel on the left.

**Q's:**
* What's different between these two outputs?
* What is happening to cause this difference?
* Try changing the values in the script. What happens if `a = 5.0`?
